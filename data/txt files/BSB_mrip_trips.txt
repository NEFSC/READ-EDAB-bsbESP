#INDICATOR_REVIEW ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#SUBMISSION_YEAR - Current year of contribution submission. This is a integer value.
2025
#INDICATOR_NAME - Name of the indicator - text string (unique to the indicator).
BSB_mrip_trips
#DESCRIPTION - Brief description of the indicator. Please make sure this description includes information on the spatial distribution of the indicator and how the data for the indicator are collected. The spatial resolution can be a cell size dimension (e.g., 5 km resolution for gridded data) or area of sampling for a survey. The data collection method can be brief (e.g., survey name and gear type, satellite sensor and version, stock assessment model output, fishery observer data, community reports, etc.) and can include a reference to methods detailed elswhere. This is a text string.
Total annual recreational black sea bass fishing trips for both North and South subunits. Data from NOAA Fisheries<U+2019> Marine Recreational Information Program (MRIP).
#STATUS_TRENDS - Information on the current status of the indicator in the context of historical trends. This is a text string.
Recent trip numbers are near an all-time high, but may have decreased from 2023.
#FACTORS - Information on the potential causes for observed trends and current status (focus on most recent year). This is a text string.
Catch generally reflects trip patterns. High regulatory complexity is likely contributing to recreational fishing trends.
#IMPLICATIONS - Information that briefly answers these questions: What are the implications or impacts of the observed trends on the ecosystem or ecosystem components? What do the trends mean? Why are they important? How can this information be used to inform management decisions? This is a text string.
Black sea bass is an important Mid-Atlantic stock with high recreational engagement.
#REFERENCES - Include any full references that are associated with the indicator. This may include data references such as from an ERDDAP webpage or literature cited (plus the DOI where possible). This is a text string.
