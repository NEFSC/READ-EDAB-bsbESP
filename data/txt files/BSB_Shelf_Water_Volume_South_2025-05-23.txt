#Ecosystem and Socioeconomic Profile (ESP) indicator template for Northeast ESPs 

#This template is required for updating ESP indicator information. There are two required sections to check or update (see below): Indicator Review and Indicator Data. 

#INSTRUCTIONS: Please fill in the text (surrounded by " ") or data as values in the line after each field marked with a # and capitalized name. Help text is provided following the capitalized field name. 

#INDICATOR_REVIEW ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#SUBMISSION_YEAR - Current year of contribution submission. This is a integer value.
2025
#INDICATOR_NAME - Name of the indicator - text string (unique to the indicator).
BSB_Shelf_Water_Volume_South
#DESCRIPTION - Brief description of the indicator. Please make sure this description includes information on the spatial distribution of the indicator and how the data for the indicator are collected. The spatial resolution can be a cell size dimension (e.g., 5 km resolution for gridded data) or area of sampling for a survey. The data collection method can be brief (e.g., survey name and gear type, satellite sensor and version, stock assessment model output, fishery observer data, community reports, etc.) and can include a reference to methods detailed elswhere. This is a text string.
Shelf water volume (km^3) for the Southern stock subunit. Shelf water volume is a measure of the volume of water inshore of the shelf-slope front, a narrow transition region between masses of cool, low salinity shelf water and warm, high salinity slope water. This in-situ data was derived from CTD data from NEFSC surveys and is maintained by Paula Fratantoni.
#STATUS_TRENDS - Information on the current status of the indicator in the context of historical trends. This is a text string.
There has been no winter sampling since 2021, no trend for 2024.
#FACTORS - Information on the potential causes for observed trends and current status (focus on most recent year). This is a text string.
There has been no winter sampling since 2021, no trend for 2024.
#IMPLICATIONS - Information that briefly answers these questions: What are the implications or impacts of the observed trends on the ecosystem or ecosystem components? What do the trends mean? Why are they important? How can this information be used to inform management decisions? This is a text string.
Shelf water volume is a proxy for suitable winter habitat; higher shelf water volume indicates less suitable habitat, potentially leading to northern fish migrating into the southern subregion.
#REFERENCES - Include any full references that are associated with the indicator. This may include data references such as from an ERDDAP webpage or literature cited (plus the DOI where possible). This is a text string.
